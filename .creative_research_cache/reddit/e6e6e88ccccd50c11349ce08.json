BUT before everyone is going ahead writing how this phone has the best mobile processor on the market - hear me out first ..\n\nAll im doing is writing Whatsapp Messages ( yea im in Europe, Germany - there is absolutely no point in iMessage over here ), browsing reddit, watching Youtube Videos ( which is amazing on such a nice big AMOLED Screen ) and taking photos ( which is super nice with the variety of cameras on the back and totally enough for my personal use - i dont need super professional photos for pesonal use on my phone and its got 128 GB of storage for everything )  While all these tasks can be done for a very long time due to 4.000 mAh battery \n\nNow the big thing is that all these things run smoothly - absolutely no problems whatsoever. Do most people really do more with their phones? Im talking about more demanding tasks.\n\nFrom my point of view everybody fails to talk about real Budget phones ( Do they even exist in their world ) Its always about \"Big new flagship here - big new flagship there - flagship killer over there - OH THERE IS AN IPHONE FOR 479€ THATS HUGE BANG FOR BUCK ) ... while im on my device thats 289€ of the shelf and looking better for everything i do.\n\nWhere am i going wrong? Do i fail to see why the processor is such a big deal on a phone thats doing nothing for professional use? Do Tech reviewers dont know about things like the Galaxy A-Series?

There should be a Headphone Jack, imagine buying an incomplete phone  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResearch Process:  \n\nFirst step is forming a list of outliers that'd commonly appear on the searches; Googling 2022 best phones, and then slipping-in budget in the middle right after reading through the top articles and see if there's any budget phones that got in on the former results. Right after that, watching Smartphone Awards of established Tech Youtubers such as: MKBHD, Mrwhoseboss, JerryRig (if you want to find out the device's durability). After that, I did my own phone searching by using GSM Arena site's phone finder—search filters used is pretty much the criteria above.

The sweet spot of 8GB RAM + 128GB ROM is priced at exactly $299 at my place currently.\n\n  \n\nAlthough, the other 2 is very close and it all comes down to your preferences. An example would be that Poco X3 Pro is actually better in terms of Gaming performance but is only bested by RN12 Pro with its superior Display quality and better network Connectivity, considering the X3 Pro is a year older. And Infinix Zero 2023 is only slightly worse than the RN12 Pro on the camera aspect, which means if you're someone who doesn't really mind the camera quality aspect that much then it", "author": "darkov7", "likes": 65, "created_at": "1676753432.0", "raw": {"id": "115qo7z", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/115qo7z/the_best_latest_202223_budget_phone_below_300/", "permalink": "/r/Android/comments/115qo7z/the_best_latest_202223_budget_phone_below_300/"}}, {"source": "reddit", "text": "[POST] Three Android phones make it's way to the list of Top 10 best selling phones of 2023\n", "author": "TwelveSilverSwords", "likes": 544, "created_at": "1707396067.0", "raw": {"id": "1aluthu", "url": "https://x.com/curunnil/status/1755570752378585255?s=20", "permalink": "/r/Android/comments/1aluthu/three_android_phones_make_its_way_to_the_list_of/"}}, {"source": "reddit", "text": "[POST] Benchmarking the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2: Setting expectations for flagship smartphones in 2023\n", "author": "FragmentedChicken", "likes": 950, "created_at": "1669043610.0", "raw": {"id": "z11dkc", "url": "https://www.xda-developers.com/benchmarking-snapdragon-8-gen-2/", "permalink": "/r/Android/comments/z11dkc/benchmarking_the_snapdragon_8_gen_2_setting/"}}, {"source": "reddit", "text": "[POST] The best camera smartphones 2023 in review - Apple and Xiaomi fall short of Samsung's best performance\n", "author": "Antonis_32", "likes": 141, "created_at": "1701276895.0", "raw": {"id": "186u429", "url": "https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-best-camera-smartphones-2023-in-review-Apple-and-Xiaomi-fall-short-of-Samsung-s-best-performance.775522.0.html", "permalink": "/r/Android/comments/186u429/the_best_camera_smartphones_2023_in_review_apple/"}}, {"source": "reddit", "text": "[POST] Difference in the smartphone culture in India and the US.\nOk, so in the last few months where I have been browsing through this subreddit a lot, I have noticed some very clear differences in how people in my country (India) and people in US use/need features and, overall, their Android. I find these differences fascinating. English isn't my first language, so sorry for the mistakes. Also, I may be wrong in my assumptions, so feel free to correct me and explain :) \n\n\nFirst off, preferred phone size. People here, and in China too I guess, love huge phones. 5.5\" is pretty common, with 6\" phones also selling very well, though some people like me prefer 5\". But anything smaller than that is considered 'tiny'. Whereas I have seen many westerners here constantly asking for 4.5\" phones, for ease of use. Do people in the US watch movies on their phones? Do they have smaller hands? Also, are smaller phones only a requirement of a few redditors, or is this a common thing among the Android users? Please note that I'm asking these questions out of pure curiosity. \n\n\nSecond, sms usage. I have seen this discussion quite a lot of times, especially along the lines of Allo-Whatsapp-iMessage. Sms is something we don't actively use for personal communication anymore. Its just there for notifications from banks, getting OTPs, and such. We use primarily Whatsapp and FB Messenger for communication here. Sms fallback (like iMesaage) is not something we want because sms is quite expensive here, and frankly, we just don't use sms much anymore. I think i understand this difference pretty well, but explanation about something I might have missed is welcome. \n\n\nThird, budget tier smartphones. Maybe its just reddit, but I get the impression that flagship phones are the most popular ones in the US. India is a huge market for budget smartphones because, lets face it, India is indeed an economically backward country. But the budget section I'm talking about is the sub-15k (around $230), with", "author": "S4G3R_BUG", "likes": 5488, "created_at": "1494137916.0", "raw": {"id": "69pxao", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/69pxao/difference_in_the_smartphone_culture_in_india_and/", "permalink": "/r/Android/comments/69pxao/difference_in_the_smartphone_culture_in_india_and/"}}, {"source": "reddit", "text": "[POST] Best/Worst smartphone manufacturer in the €200-350 range\nHi everyone!\nI wanted to know which smartphone manufacturer is the best and also the worst in the €200-350 range, among these manufacturers:\n\nMotorola\nOppo / Realme\nSamsung\nXiaomi / Redmi / Poco.\n\nfocusing on two fundamental aspects:\n\n- Software reliability (lag and bugs)\n- Hardware reliability (construction, durability, overall quality)\n", "author": "Gionlerck", "likes": 10, "created_at": "1749458803.0", "raw": {"id": "1l6zqd6", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1l6zqd6/bestworst_smartphone_manufacturer_in_the_200350/", "permalink": "/r/Android/comments/1l6zqd6/bestworst_smartphone_manufacturer_in_the_200350/"}}, {"source": "reddit", "text": "[POST] [Amateur Photographer] Tecno Camon 40 Premier 5G Review: I wish more countries sold this budget smartphone\n", "author": "LastChancellor", "likes": 25, "created_at": "1744963835.0", "raw": {"id": "1k1zq6e", "url": "https://amateurphotographer.com/review/tecno-camon-40-premier-5g-review/", "permalink": "/r/Android/comments/1k1zq6e/amateur_photographer_tecno_camon_40_premier_5g/"}}, {"source": "reddit", "text": "[POST] The BEST Smartphones of 2023!

The cream of the crop.\n\nThe flagship phones of this year have come out swinging and are fighting to become the phone you pull out of your pocket. They have the best screens, the best cameras, and the best performance you can find in a smartphone. Mobile technology has come a long way in the past half decade but these flagship smartphones come at a premium. A high premium. Even though millions and millions of these phones are sold every year, not many can afford to keep upgrading every year and many can’t afford them at all.\n\nSo where do these people turn to for affordable smartphones? What about the older model smartphones? When new phones arrive, price cuts are sure to follow. The iPhone 5s is still $550 new. The Galaxy S5 is about $500. Even the LG G3 comes in at around $450 new. It’s still not that much of a difference. One is still paying a high price for the “older” model. This price range may not be low enough to make a difference to the average consumer. So they look for other ways to get the most bang out of their buck.\n\nShould they turn to eBay or secondhand stores to get used or refurbished phones? Some people might not be able to or know how to navigate these waters. The product is also always in question as it might not turn out as advertised through these outside vendors. I have learned from firsthand experience that used/refurbished might not come out as one would have hoped. Many also\n\nEnter the low end/entry level smartphone market.

I am asking because a lot of people in my friend group (even some that work in software engineering) can't really agree on what features they are looking for in a budget smartphone to make it adequate enough for either casual use or hardcore enthusiasts. As for myself, I am using the Honor 6x (as my flair would suggest) and I am completely satisfied with what I got for a mere $200. I paid for it in full, which means I own the damn thing, AND it does all the things that major flagships can do at a much lower cost. I converted to the Android darkside after using an iPhone 6 plus for so long and I have to say that there are many things that the 6 plus is missing. SURE...I am comparing devices that are years apart, but there are so many things that I rave about with this phone; the camera takes some of the better cellphone photos that I have seen in a while. It's not the best, but when you know how to use it the camera is fantastic. The fingerprint sensor is lightning fast, AND it can double as an input device while using the device! (I currently use it to draw down my notifications drawer, it makes one handed operation a lot easier for me personally) I love the display, I can't tell what type it is but it works great and seems to get a lot brighter than my iPhone ever did. \n\nI know what I am saying here should be taken with a grain of salt but for $200 I think I got a great deal and I can't imagine what phone would have been better at this price range.

This changed significantly in the 2020s when perceived performance hit a plateau and generational improvements were no longer as noticeable. Case in point, I am rocking my Oppo Reno6 Pro with Snapdragon 870 and it is the first smartphone I ever had that never slowed down with age. With flagship prices entering the 4 digit mark, here is a list of alternative smartphone SoCs that can deliver you a flagship-like experience without  a bank loan.\n\n# What and Why?\n\nA System on Chip (SoC) is the brain of your smartphones. It used to be referred to as the processor however, in recent years, this term no longer does it justice as an SoC comprises multiple processors including application, graphics, video...etc. A better SoC typically yields more performance in your system. The reason for recommending an SoC rather than particular smartphone is because smartphones with the same SoC tend to perform similarly. The other reason is that future phones are likely to come with one of these SoCs and are likely to perform well. \n\nBefore starting the list, the term \"flagship-like experience\" needs to be defined. My aforementioned phone scores an average of 700k on Antutu and yet it delivers a very smooth experience. This article will consider an SoC to deliver flagship-like experience when it scores around 1.5M or more on Antutu and when there are videos demonstrating it playing demanding games such as Genshin Impact. 1.5M score on Antutu happens to be the average score of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 smartphones such Galaxy S23 Ultra and Oneplus 11 which are still very performant to this day.\n\n# 5. Snapdragon 8 Gen 2: The Champion of 2023\n\n**Antutu Score: 1.55M**\n\n**Notable Smartphones: Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, Oneplus 11**\n\nThe flagship of 2023 remains a top performer to this day.

By summer 2026 (or earlier this year in 2025), I want a reliable mid-range to upper-mid phone (1000-1600 BYN, or about $320-$523) that will last at least four years. I need a good camera, particularly strong macro and telephoto capabilities, and the ability to flash stock firmware via PC (bootloader unlock is essential). I’m prioritizing hardware reliability, camera quality, and flashing ease over official software support.In Belarus, the market is dominated by grey imports, and there are no reliable warranties.

I’m even considering Apple IPhone as a last resort, despite its high cost and potential annoyances due to sanctions.

However, here is a list of other options that I found from other brands in case they are recommended:\n\n\\- TCL 50SE\n\n\\- HONOR X6B\n\n\\- OPPO A38\n\n\\- REALME NOTE 50\n\n\\- REALME C53\n\n\\- VIVO Y03\n\nThere are so many options that it is difficult for me to choose, I am not a very demanding user in terms of power, so far I have done well with my Moto G20 which only has 4GB of RAM and a Unisoc T700 processor, however it got stuck on Android 11 and received the last security update in mid-2023, maybe that is why the performance has remained stable. However, I would like to improve the power a little if possible, just for more comfort when browsing and that.\n\nGiving a summary of how I usually use the smartphone so you can get an idea of ​​what could be the best: Video games I only play Brawl stars and Soul Knight occasionally, the latter sometimes jerks but nothing serious, so I suppose that some of the new options will be more than enough for me. Otherwise, I mostly use the smartphone to watch videos on YouTube, as well as use social networks like Pinterest and Discord (I don't use Facebook or X, Instagram used to but my account was stolen recently).

After using my Samsung Galaxy S Duos 2 for 7 years ( I know, I know, I am a masochist) I finally made the decision to throw that old pain in the ass away and buy a new smartphone. At first I was thinking about Motorola, considering that the brand is usually regarded as the best choice within 200-400$ price range, but, for some unknown reason, stores in my country only have the old ones. After realizing that Motorola isn't the way to go for me I shifted my attention towards the good ol' Samsung and I am kind of confused which one to pick. There is A22, but I've read some criticism about it, so I am not sure whether it's a good choice. There are A41 and M31, which have lots of positive reviews, but they were released in 2020 and I am afraid that Samsung will stop supporting them in 2023. I want my phone to work smoothly for at least 2 or 3 years, before it'll start getting on my nerves. There is A52, but only the 4GB RAM version and I don't think that it's worth 400 bucks (to tell the truth, almost every mid-range Samsung here has 4GB RAM, except M31). So which Smartphone will you recommend to me? I can afford anything below 400$.\n\nP.S. Just to clarify, I am not against other brands, it's just the matter of availability to me, considering that the pandemic in my country hit the tech market really hard. And yes, I was thinking about Xiaomi, but there are too many people complaining about it's software and hardware, so I am kind of cautious.", "author": "TheSenate99", "likes": 5, "created_at": "1641208073.0", "raw": {"id": "ruzb1i", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/ruzb1i/what_smartphone_should_i_buy_in_2022/", "permalink": "/r/Smartphones/comments/ruzb1i/what_smartphone_should_i_buy_in_2022/"}}, {"source": "reddit", "text": "[POST] Best android smartphone, no budget limit\n\\*serious post\\*  \nbeen surveying for a phone that can last long and handle abuse well (my xiaomi 9t pro will be 7 years old this november, so far only the power button needed to be glued back twice!)
