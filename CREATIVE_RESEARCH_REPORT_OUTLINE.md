## 1B. Video Scrapes

For each platform, define what to scrape and which metrics matter.

| Platform | What to Scrape | Key Metrics | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| **YouTube (long-form)** | Videos matching product hashtags/search | Views, likes, comments, CTR, watch time % | Focus on reviews, unboxing, “best X” |

---

# STEP 2: COMMENTS ANALYSIS

**Goal:** Find comments that relate to the product — real language, objections, and desires.

---

## 2A. Comment Scrapes

| Source | What to Scrape | What to Extract |
|--------|----------------|------------------|

**Deliverables:**

- **Verbatim comment banks** (by theme): desire, objection, question, comparison, surprise

- **Sentiment summary:** What people love vs. doubt vs. ask

---

## 2B. Thematic Clusters

- **Desires:** What people say they want (outcomes, benefits, feelings)
- **Objections:** Price, trust, “does it work”, side effects, etc.
- **Questions:** Recurring “how”, “when”, “where”, “which”
- **Comparisons:** “vs. X”, “better than”, “similar to”
- **Surprise / delight:** Unexpected positives mentioned in comments

---

# STEP 3: AVATAR ANGLES

**Goal:** Turn Steps 1–2 + client input into clear avatars and messaging pillars.

---

## 3A. Avatars (10 Different Avatars to Target)

For each avatar (1–10), provide:

- **Name / label** (e.g. “Busy Mom Who Wants Quick Results”)
- **Demographics:** Age range, location type, life stage (optional)
- **Psychographics:** Mindset, values, what they care about
- **Where they are:** Platforms, content they consume, who they follow
- **Relationship to product:** Why they’d care, main motivation
- **Objections:** What might hold them back
- **Message that resonates:** One line or angle that fits this avatar
- **Source:** Which comments/videos from Steps 1–2 support this avatar

---

## 3B. Overview — Messaging Pillars

- **Top 10 Key Selling Points**
  - Ranked or grouped by strength (evidence from comments + videos)
  - One line each + short “proof” (e.g. “mentioned in X% of comments” or “dominant in top videos”)

- **10 Core Desires**
  - What the audience wants to feel or achieve (outcome-focused)
  - Tied to verbatim language from comments where possible

- **10 Pain Points / Problems**
  - Frustrations, fears, and “current state” problems
  - Again, tied to real phrases from research

---

## 3C. Client Details (Optional Add-On)

- **Brand voice / guidelines** (if provided by client)
- **Do’s and don’ts** (claims, competitors, tone)
- **Current assets** (existing ads, site, key messages) — link and one-line summary
- **Gaps vs. research:** What the research suggests that current messaging doesn’t yet address

---

# EXECUTION NOTES

- **Product link as input:** All scrapes and competitor lists should be derived from or validated against the actual product (name, category, claims, price range).
- **Refresh cadence:** Suggest “monthly” for Organic Concepts (1D) and “per project” for full report.
- **Tooling:** Outline assumes use of scrapers/APIs or manual collection; exact tools can be specified in a separate runbook.
- **Output format:** Markdown or PDF; tables and bullet lists as above for easy copy-paste into briefs and creative docs.
